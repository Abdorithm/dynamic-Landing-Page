# Development

The main idea of this project is to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript. All of the features are 
processed as follows: <br>

### 1. Building the navigation. <br>
By iterating over sections using <code>forEach()</code> method, then creating <code>li</code> & <code>a</code> elements
and adding <code>class</code> & <code>href</code> attributes to the <code>a</code> elements. Finally populating the navigation
with them and using the HTML <code>data attribute</code> in each section to set the <code>textContent()</code> to each anchor accordingly.

### 2. Mobile Navigation. <br>
Using the CSS <code>@media</code> at-rule, The navigation menu is changed in smaller screen widths (<768 px)<br>
<pre>@media screen and (max-width: 767px) { /* new properties/design */ }</pre>
It's that simple. The JavaScript part is using <code>addEventListenerer()</code> & <code>classList.toggle()</code> to set the animations on a click event.

### 3. Highlighting a section when in the viewport. <br>
This is done by using <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code> method & <code>clientHeight</code> read-only property to get the position of each section 
relative to the viewport, then setting conditionals that add the animations by using <code>classList</code> if they're met.

### 4. Scrolling to sections. <br>
The <code>scrollTo()</code> event helps to smooth-scroll to a particular position. By using <code>offsetTop</code> read-only property, we can get the y/top coord of the
wanted section. <br>
When an anchor in clicked, the target section's ID is stored, as it is the <code>href</code> attribute of that anchor.
<pre>const targetSection = anchor.currentTarget.getAttribute('href');</pre>
and there you go, smooth-scrolling like a beast!üê±‚Äçüë§
